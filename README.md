### Project Description
Find AND Replace is a fast, browser-based tool that allows users to replace words in PDFs without altering formatting. It preserves the original layout, fonts, and text alignment while ensuring real-time word replacements—all without uploading files to a server!




### The Problem statement}
As a computer science student we have to change the user name in every program to take print outs for lab records ,it take almost 1-2 hours to edit all the files .we noted that a lot of time was wasted through this process ,Hence the idea

### The Solution
Our browser-based tool streamlines PDF text replacement by allowing users to upload a PDF, specify the word to be changed, and download the modified version instantly. It ensures original formatting, font styles, and alignment are preserved while making the edits.


### **Project Description**  
We developed a web-based tool that allows users to upload a PDF, specify a word to be replaced, and provide the updated word. The website then automatically processes the PDF, replaces the specified word while preserving the original formatting, and generates a downloadable version of the edited PDF—all within seconds.  

This eliminates the need for manual editing, making the process faster, more efficient, and error-free. Since the tool runs entirely in the browser, users can edit PDFs without uploading files to external servers, ensuring data privacy and security.

Find and Replace is a frontend-only web application that allows users to upload a PDF, replace specific words, and download the modified version while preserving the original formatting. It eliminates the need for manual PDF editing, which is often time-consuming and tedious.

The tool works by extracting text from the uploaded PDF using pdf.js, replacing the specified words using pdf-lib, and regenerating the document while ensuring that the original font, alignment, and layout remain intact. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it runs entirely in the browser, ensuring speed, security, and privacy, as no data is sent to external servers.

Hosted on Vercel, GitHub Pages, Find and Replace is easily accessible and automatically updates when changes are made. It provides a fast, free, and efficient way to edit PDFs without requiring additional software installations, making it an ideal solution for students, professionals, and anyone needing quick text replacements in documents
