### Project Description
This project is a web-based safety and emergency assistance system designed to help individuals, especially women, navigate safely and access emergency support when needed. The platform integrates features such as real-time location tracking, emergency alerts, a precautionary checklist, and live guardian assistance to enhance security and provide immediate response during critical situations.

### The Problem statement
Women face safety concerns daily, especially while traveling alone, commuting at night, or in unfamiliar locations. In emergencies, quick access to help, secure routes, and real-time tracking is often unavailable or inefficient. Traditional safety measures like phone calls to family or self-defense tools are not always practical in high-risk situations.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre turning your phone into a personal safety superhero! 
Imagine having a guardian angel, a smart navigator, and an emergency siren all packed into one easy-to-use web app. That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre building‚Äîa smart safety companion that helps you stay safe and connected, no matter where you are.
