### Project Description
The primary mission of this website is to create an online environment where communication barriers are reduced, and everyone, regardless of their ability to hear or speak, can access, participate, and connect. The project aims to empower individuals to express themselves fully, access vital information, and engage in a supportive community of peers.

By providing these resources and tools, the website will foster independence, increase accessibility, and help bridge communication gaps for people who are deaf, hard of hearing, or non-verbal.
### The Problem statement
The ability to quickly and clearly alert someone to an emergency, no matter their ability to hear or speak, makes the website not only accessible but life-saving in critical moments. It's ridiculous that these simple safety features aren't standard on all platforms already‚Äîso having it here would be a huge step forward in making the internet a truly inclusive and safe space

### The Solution
Real-Time Alerts: In case of an emergency, the website would have a dedicated notification system that sends alerts to all users in real time. It could notify users about natural disasters, safety concerns, or any immediate actions they need to take.
For Users Who Can‚Äôt Hear: When someone speaks, the website can transcribe their speech into text in real time, allowing those who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow the conversation without missing out on important details. This would be invaluable for webinars, meetings, or casual chats.
