### Project Description
[Cyberbullying Detection System Using AI
Our platform leverages the power of artificial intelligence to create a safer and more respectful online space. This system allows users to share posts and engage with comments in a supportive environment.

Key Features:

User Interaction: Users can post content and receive comments from others.
AI-Powered Comment Analysis: Each comment is analyzed in real-time by our AI system to detect any form of vulgar or harmful language.
Notification System: If a comment contains inappropriate content, the system immediately notifies the user with options to either Ignore or Report the comment.
Seamless Reporting: Upon selecting Report, the system registers the complaint for further review, ensuring a transparent and actionable process.
This tool is designed to empower users and foster a positive online experience, making the internet a safer place for everyone.While this version is a simple implementation without AI due to time constraints, it lays the foundation for creating a system that prioritizes safety and respect online]

### The Problem statement

[Cyberbullying is a growing issue in today‚Äôs digital world, affecting millions of users across online platforms. It can lead to emotional distress, a decline in self-esteem, and even mental health issues. Unfortunately, many users feel powerless to address these negative experiences effectively.

Our website tackles this problem by providing:

A Safer Space: Encouraging positive interactions by monitoring and flagging inappropriate comments.
User Empowerment: Enabling users to take control by notifying them of harmful comments and giving them the choice to either Ignore or Report.
Accountability: Helping users take action against harmful behavior and discouraging negative interactions.
By addressing these challenges, the platform promotes a healthier and more respectful online environment.]
