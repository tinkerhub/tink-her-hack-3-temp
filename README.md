### Project Description
The  DocTrace  Project is a specialised website that allows finders to post pertinent papers or information in order to help people retrieve misplaced belongings. Using sophisticated filters like date, category, or location, users may effectively search for their misplaced belongings, guaranteeing a smooth and well-organised retrieval process.

### The Problem statement
One common yet serious problem that people encounter is the loss of crucial documents, such as identification cards, certifications, and legal documents. The absence of a centralised and effective lost-and-found system leads to serious financial hardships, security threats, and inconveniences. 

Conventional techniques, including posting on social media, visiting several locations, or physically posting bulletin boards, are frequently time-consuming and unproductive. Furthermore, there is no organised method for recovering misplaced documents and returning them to their proper owners.

### The Solution
On the web-based platform Doctrace,
Finders can contribute information about misplaced documents, including type, date, location, and image. 
Losers ask for verification and use filters to search. Rightful recovery is ensured via secure verification.
 In-app chat, secure email relay, or contact request system allow for direct connection between the finder and the loser while protecting privacy. 
 Tracking and notifications keep users informed.
