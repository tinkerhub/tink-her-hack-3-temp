### Project Description
Rubeus is a comprehensive healthcare platform designed to empower women with PCOD/PCOS through integrated tracking, mental wellness support, and educational resources. The platform combines symptom monitoring, lifestyle tracking, and mental health assessment tools with medically accurate sexual health information.

### The Problem statement
Women with PCOD face significant challenges in managing their physical symptoms, mental health, and reproductive wellness due to fragmented healthcare resources and widespread misinformation. The lack of an integrated platform makes it difficult to effectively track symptoms, monitor mental well-being, and access reliable sex education, hindering their ability to make informed decisions about their health.

### The Solution
Rubeus is a comprehensive web platform that empowers women with PCOD through integrated health tracking, mental wellness tools, and expert-verified educational resources. It combines symptom monitoring, personalized lifestyle recommendations, and mental health assessments with reliable sexual health information, all in one user-friendly interface.
