Farmer's Unit Demo

Project Description
The Farmer‚Äôs Unit project facilitates the sale of local farm products and provides detailed information about crops produced locally. It helps increase farmers' profits by eliminating middlemen. Customers can directly access product details such as price, quantity, and availability, and farmers can sell their crops in a timely manner before the shelf life expires.

The Problem Statement
Customers have direct access to local farmers, ensuring better quality products.
Farmers can sell crops before they spoil, avoiding wastage and maximizing profits.
The Solution
The solution is a user-friendly website that connects local farmers directly with customers. It provides a platform where customers can get updated information about available products, prices, and quantities, and farmers can easily list and manage their products.
