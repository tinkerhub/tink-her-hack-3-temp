      <h1>Cancer:A Silent Storm That Changes Lives</h1>
      <p>Cancer is not just a disease—it is a life-altering battle, one that begins silently and grows unnoticed until it forces its presence into lives. It is a condition where the body's own cells begin to multiply uncontrollably, forming tumors that invade tissues and spread across vital organs. There are more than 100 types of cancer, affecting different parts of the body, from the lungs and breasts to the blood, bones, and brain.
      </p>
      <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Cancer often disguises itself in subtle ways, making early detection crucial. Some of the most common symptoms include:
      </p>
      <ul>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss and persistent fatigue</li> 
    <li>Lumps or swelling in any part of the body</li>
    <li>Changes in the skin, such as darkening, yellowing, or unusual moles</li>
    <li>Persistent pain that has no clear cause</li>
    <li>Unusual bleeding or bruising</li>
    <li>Chronic cough or difficulty swallowing</li>
    <li>Changes in bowel or bladder habits</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>While these symptoms may be caused by other conditions, ignoring them can be dangerous. Early detection saves lives.Treatment—whether through surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or immunotherapy—can be grueling, leading to hair loss, weakened immunity, nausea, and intense pain. The emotional toll is just as severe, with many facing depression, anxiety, and fear of the unknown.More than 40% of cancers can be prevented through lifestyle changes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption</li>
        <li> Maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise</li>
        <li> Protecting skin from harmful UV radiation</li>
        <li>Getting vaccinated against cancer-causing viruses (like HPV and Hepatitis B)</li>
        <li>Going for regular screenings and early check-ups </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Cancer may be powerful, but so is human resilience, compassion, and medical progress. By spreading awareness, supporting research, and standing by those affected, we can turn the tide against this disease. Because no one should have to fight cancer alone.</p>
